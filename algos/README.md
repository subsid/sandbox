  ## Sliding Window

  1) [AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK](sliding_window/AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK.java)

  Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‘K’ in it.

  2) [Fruits and Baskets](sliding_window/fruits_into_baskets.py)

  Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

  You can start with any tree, but you can’t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

  3) [Longest Substring With K Distinct](sliding_window/LongestSubstringKDistinct.java)

  Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.

  4) [Max Sum Subarray of Size K](sliding_window/MaxSumSubArrayOfSizeK.java)

  Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘k,’ find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size ‘k’.

  5) [Minsize subarray sum](sliding_window/MinSizeSubArraySum.java)

    Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S,’ find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0 if no such subarray exists.

  6) [Non repeating substring](sliding_window/non_repeat_substring.py)

  Given a string, find the length of the longest substring, which has no repeating characters.

  7) [Longest substring with same letter after replacement](sliding_window/length_of_longest_substring.py)

  Given a string with lowercase letters only, if you are allowed to replace no more than ‘k’ letters with any letter, find the length of the longest substring having the same letters after replacement.

  8) [Longest Subarray with ones after replacement](sliding window/length_of_longest_subarray)

  Given an array containing 0s and 1s, if you are allowed to replace no more than ‘k’ 0s with 1s, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray having all 1s.

  9) [Permutation in a string](sliding_window/contains_permutation)

  Given a string and a pattern, find out if the string contains any permutation of the pattern.

  10) [Find Anagrams of given string](sliding_window/find_anagrams.py)

  Given a string and a pattern, find all anagrams of the pattern in the given string.

  11) [Find min length substring](sliding_window/min_length_substring.py)

  Given a string and a pattern, find the smallest substring in the given string which has all the characters of the given pattern.

  12) [Word concatenation](sliding_window/word_concatenation.py)

  Given a string and a list of words, find all the starting indices of substrings in the given string that are a concatenation of all the given words exactly once without any overlapping of words. It is given that all words are of the same length.

1) [Target Sum Pair](two_pointers/target_sum_pair.py)

Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target. Write a function to return the indices of the two numbers (i.e. the pair) such that they add up to the given target.

2) [Remove Duplicates][two_pointers/remove_duplicates.py]

Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates from it. You should not use any extra space; after removing the duplicates in-place return the length of the subarray that has no duplicate in it.

3) [Remove Key][two_pointers/remove_key.py]

Given an unsorted array of numbers and a target ‘key’, remove all instances of ‘key’ in-place and return the new length of the array.


4) [Sorted squares][two_pointers/sorted_squares.py]

Given a sorted array, create a new array containing squares of all the numbers of the input array in the sorted order.
